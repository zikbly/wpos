1. Install Xampp version 5.6.19. Any other version of Xampp might not work.

2. Uncomment mod_proxy_http & mod_proxy_wstunnel in the apache config file (C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf).

3. Add the block of code below to C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf:

<VirtualHost *:443>

DocumentRoot /xampp/htdocs/wpos
ServerName 127.0.0.1

#ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
#CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

SSLEngine on
SSLCipherSuite !ADH:!DSS:!RC4:HIGH:+3DES:+RC4
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
SSLCertificateFile /xampp/apache/conf/ssl.crt/server.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /xampp/apache/conf/ssl.key/server.key

<Directory /xampp/htdocs/wpos >
    AllowOverride all
</Directory>

# WSPROXY CONF
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPreserveHost On
<Proxy *>
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
</Proxy>
ProxyPass /socket.io/1/websocket/ ws://localhost:8080/socket.io/1/websocket/
ProxyPassReverse /socket.io/1/websocket/ ws://localhost:8080/socket.io/1/websocket
ProxyPass /socket.io/ http://localhost:8080/socket.io/
ProxyPassReverse /socket.io/ http://localhost:8080/socket.io/
<Location /socket.io>
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Location>

</VirtualHost>

4. Add C:\xampp to the PATH environment variable.

5. Install nodejs in the C:\xampp directory.

6. Run "npm install socket.io" from CMD and make sure socket.io is installed with the path C:\xampp\htdocs\wpos\api\node_modules\socket.io\. Afterward, crosscheck if node_modules\socket.io is really in the api directory, otherwise copy it there.

7. Create database in phpmyadmin with name "dev" and import "install.sql" file at C:\xampp\htdocs\wpos\library\installer\schemas\

8. Access localhost "https://localhost/installer". Don't forget to add "https://" otherwise it won't work.

9. During the setup installation, use "dev" as Database name and "root" as Database username. Leave password field blank.

10. When asked to provide a password for "admin" during the setup installation, just use "12345678"; I have no idea what that password is for.

11. If you make it to the POS admin login page, use "admin" as both username and password to successfully login.

NB: If you try to access the POS admin login page and it gets stuck on the "initializing page", just close the tab, re-open a new tab and try again. If that doesn't work also, close the tab,  restart apache and MySQL in Xampp, re-open a new tab, and try again.
